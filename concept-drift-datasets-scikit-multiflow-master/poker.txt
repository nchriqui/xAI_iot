One million randomly drawn poker hands are represented by five cards each encoded with its suit and rank. The class is the resulting poker hand itself such as one pair, full house and so forth. This dataset has in its original form no drift, since the poker hand definitions
do not change and the instances are randomly generated. However, the version used is the one in which virtual drift is introduced via sorting the instances by rank and suit. Duplicate hands were also removed. It contains 829200 instances, 10 attributes and 10 classes.
