Ten of the colorful buildings next to the famous Rialto bridge in Venice are encoded in a normalized 27-dimensional RGB histogram. We obtained the images from time-lapse videos captured by a webcam with fixed position. The recordings cover 20 consecutive days during may-june 2016. Continuously changing weather and lighting conditions affect the representation. We generated the labels by manually masking the corresponding buildings and excluded overnight recordings since they were too dark for being useful. It contains 82250 instances, 27 attributes and 10 classes.
