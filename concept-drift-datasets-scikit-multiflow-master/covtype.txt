Assigns cartographic variables such as elevation, slope, soil type, . . . of 30 Ã— 30 meter cells to different forest cover types. Only forests with minimal human-caused disturbances were used, so that resulting forest cover types are more a result of ecological processes. It contains 581, 012 instances, 54 attributes and 7 classes.
