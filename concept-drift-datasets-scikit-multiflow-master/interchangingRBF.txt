Fifteen Gaussians with random covariance matrices are replacing each other every 3000 samples. Thereby, the number of Gaussians switching their position increases each time by one until all are simultaneously changing their location. This allows to evaluate an algorithm in the context of abrupt drift with increasing strength. Altogether 67 abrupt drifts are occurring within this dataset. It contains 200K instances, 2 attributes and 15 classes, drift type: real abrupt.
