Four equidistantly separated, squared uniform distributions are moving in horizontal direction with constant speed. The direction is inverted whenever the leading square reaches a predefined boundary. Each square represents a different class. The added value of this dataset is the predefined time horizon of 120 examples before old instances may start to overlap current ones. This is especially useful for dynamic sliding window approaches, allowing to test whether the size is adjusted accordingly. It contains 200K instances, 2 attributes and 4 classes, drift type: real incremental.
