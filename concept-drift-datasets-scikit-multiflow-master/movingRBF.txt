Gaussian distributions with random initial positions, weights and standard deviations are moved with constant speed v in d-dimensional space. The weight controls the partitioning of the examples among the Gaussians. We used the Random RBF generator in MOA with the same parametrization as in [13] (10 dimensions, 50 Gaussians, 5 classes, v=0.001). It contains 200K instances, 10 attributes and 5 classes, drift type: real incremental.
